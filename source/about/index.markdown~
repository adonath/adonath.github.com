Ay name is Axel Donath and I've studied physics in Heidelberg with Astronomy and Astrophysics
as major subjects. Currently I'm working on my Master thesis at the Max-Planck Institute for
Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. My focus lies on Very-High-Energy data analysis.
Furthermore I'm working as a student assistant at the Heidelberg Collaboration for Image
Processing (HCI) where I do research for optical flow estimation.
I've been programming in Python for about 3 yrs, mainly working with numpy, scipy and matplotlib
for numerics and PyQt4 for GUI development. 

During the GSoC 2013 I will contribute mainly to the AstroPy photutils package, especially in the
field of PSF/aperture fitting and source detection.
